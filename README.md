Yes, yes, I know. RTFM and all that...

Some people might frown upon the fact that I've put together my own little cheathseet here for the world to see, instead of reading the [Bible](https://wiki.archlinux.org) from cover to cover as I probably should.

But, I can't be arsed to memorize all the darn commands and steps and options and keep-in-minds and whatnots, and I don't fancy having a gazillion browser tabs open whenever I need to reinstall it, so I'll do what's forbidden and put together my own little step-by-steps here.

The <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org">Holy Book</a> is amazeballs, don't get me wrong.
